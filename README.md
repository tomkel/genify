# genify
Build spotify playlists from saved music based on their type and genre.

## Usage
Environment variables `ECHONEST_API_KEY` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` must be
set in order for the script to work. Unfortunately the Echo Nest API is so
heavily rate limited that it is not possible to have all users using the same API key.

You can register for these API keys
[here](https://developer.echonest.com/account/register) and
[here](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications).
